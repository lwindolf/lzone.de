To be fixed
===========

- handle feeds that return HTTP 403 when fetched via Cloudflare (e.g. https://feeds.megaphone.fm/GLT4787413333)
- feed delete does not remove from sidebar
- feed with download failure should have error icons
- feeds without favicon should have feed default icon

Refactor
========

- even with allowCorsProxy=true try fetching directly first (to avoid exposing to Cloudflare)
- webpack mjs vendor libs
- late load CSS for pdfjs
- Section (ContentTree)
  - move document:: and section:: settings to DB aggregator
  - load entire tree in one generic way from sidebar
- isolate "LZone" aggegrator from instance "lzone.de"
  - two repos
  - lzone.de specific components not in "LZone"
  - maybe provide other "LZone" instances for philosophy or gardening

Future
======

- LZone: support WebDAV syncing
- LZone: implement WebDAV based backup/restore
- LZone: implement notes component
- LZone: Allow PDFs as data source instead of repo
- LZone: maybe allow for PDF collections linked from Markdown as data source too
  - maybe ad-hoc install those
- LZone: build a shallow h1/h2 index on all content from extra-cheat-sheets.json using an e.g. monthly CICD pipeline
  - make search check this index too
  - results should rank lower than installed ones
  - when user selects a match in this index, suggest installing the cheat sheet 
- lzone.de: Implement CVE Tracker component
