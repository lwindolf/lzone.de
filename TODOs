To be fixed
===========

- feed with download failure should have error icons
- feed info has no indication of updating state

Refactor
========

- webpack mjs vendor libs
- late load CSS for pdfjs
- Section (ContentTree)
  - move document:: and section:: settings to DB aggregator
  - load entire tree in one generic way from sidebar
- isolate "LZone" aggegrator from instance "lzone.de"
  - two repos
  - lzone.de specific components not in "LZone"
  - maybe provide other "LZone" instances for philosophy or gardening
- last updated labels should have relative time (x ago)

Future
======

- LZone: support WebDAV syncing
- LZone: implement WebDAV based backup/restore
- LZone: implement notes component
- LZone: Allow PDFs as data source instead of repo
- LZone: maybe allow for PDF collections linked from Markdown as data source too
  - maybe ad-hoc install those
- LZone: build a shallow h1/h2 index on all content from extra-cheat-sheets.json using an e.g. monthly CICD pipeline
  - make search check this index too
  - results should rank lower than installed ones
  - when user selects a match in this index, suggest installing the cheat sheet 
- lzone.de: Implement CVE Tracker component
